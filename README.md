# Welcome to Myeongseok's GitHub Page

I'm __Ryu Myeongseok__, a __Ph.D. student__ in the [__Department of Mechanical and Robotics Engineering__](https://me.gist.ac.kr/meeng/) at [__Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology__ (GIST)](https://www.gist.ac.kr/kr/main.html). 

> [!NOTE]
> I will move to the [__Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility__](https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/en/) at [__Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology__ (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/) in May 2025.

I'm currently a member of the [__Mobility Intelligence & Control Laboratory (MIC Lab)__](https://kaist-mic-lab.github.io) at __GIST__. 
The MIC Lab is a research group led by Prof. __Kyunghwan Choi__.

## Interested Research Fields

My research interests include:
- Control Theory
- Machine Learning
- Optimization

Final goal of my research is to develop a control algorithm that enables
- deep learning techniques integration (including DNN, CNN, LSTM, etc).
- online adaptation (learning) ensuring the system stability.
- mathematical analysis of control performance.
- (control input, state/output) contraints handling.
